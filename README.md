# dreadhalls
This is the Dreadhalls assignment for CS50's Introduction to Game Development for Harvard University. This submission was made by Eduardo Salinas.

## Notes

### Use of GitHub Copilot
I'm paying for GitHub Copilot's Individual Subscription, which generated some of my code. I will add all the instructions that I gave to Copilot that generated my code in the "References" section of this README file.

### Code generated by GitHub Copilot
I saved all the code generated by the Copilot Chat that I used in my project in a file called "copilot-chat.txt". All the Copilot code that I used that's being cited on my references can be found in that .txt file.

### Bing AI's Chat disclaimer
I, Eduardo Salinas, generated the references for this homework assignment in APA format in the "References" section of this README file using Bing AI's chat from bing.com. Upon generating draft language, I reviewed, edited, and revised the language to my own liking, and I take ultimate responsibility for the content of this text. I did not use an app to generate this citation other than Bing's AI web app. I copied the text from Bing's chat, pasted it on a text editor, and then edited it.

### Sources used from Bing's chat from bing.com
I attached a file called "Bing Chat April 10 2024.txt", which contains the chat with Bing's AI from bing.com from which I learned how to attach a script to a Prefab. It's included on my references on a section below on this README file. If you want to see the whole message generated by Bing's AI, please, check the "Bing Chat April 10 2024.txt" file.

6) Copilot Chat from Pycharm: Professional Edition. (2024, March 31). "/fix What this code is actually doing is that it either renders all the floor tiles, or it renders none. That's not what I want. What I want are just a few holes in the floor. In fact, if I put 'numberOfHoles' as '100', the floor doesn't render at all, and I fall through the floor.

This fixed the bug that either rendered the entire floor or didn't render the floor at all. Well, now fix this so that only up to 4 holes can be created on the floor. Currently, my code can generate more than 4 holes in the ground." Selected lines 74-92 from the `LevelGenerator.cs` file. Attached `LevelGenerator.cs` file. Accessed on March 31st, 2024.

10) Copilot Chat from Pycharm: Professional Edition. (2024, April 6). "Well, I have a bug in my game in which, sometimes, holes are spawned beneath the walls. The holes should NEVER be spawned beneath the walls. They need to be beneath the floor tiles of the maze. That is, after the highlighted snippet 'crawls' through the walls to create the maze where you will move around, the holes should only be created on the maze that was created by this 'crawler'. Well, is there a way to make sure that the holes on the floor only spawn on the maze roads that are created by this 'crawler', so that the holes are never spawned beneath any walls?"

11) Copilot Chat from Pycharm: Professional Edition. (2024, April 6). "/fix Thanks, now holes are never spawned beneath walls. However, now I have a bug that always spawns a hole beneath the initial position of the player. That is, unless you move the player character right when the game starts, you will always begin the game by falling through a hole. I NEVER want to spawn a hole beneath the player's starting position. Also, now 5 holes are being spawned instead of 4. Even the console tells me that only 4 holes are being spawned, even though there are 5 holes being spawned. I want the game to only spawn 4 holes, not 5. I suspect that the 5th hole that's always being rendered is the one that's being rendered beneath the player's initial position. So please, fix this snippet to ensure that only 4 holes are rendered, and that a hole is never spawned beneath the player's initial position."

24) Copilot from Visual Studio Code. A line of code was generated by Copilot's chat on VS Code. To activate that, I went to VS Code, and the variable "WhisperSource" was being selected on line 39 from `LoadSceneOnInput.cs`. So, I clicked on the "WhisperSource" variable, and I clicked on "Quick Fix" -> "Use Copilot," and VS Code's Copilot generated that line of code. Accessed on April 12th, 2024.

25) Copilot Chat from Pycharm: Professional Edition. (2024, April 12). "Modify the Awake() and OnControllerColliderHit() functions. On the Awake() function, declare a variable that is called "currentLevel", which will be an integer and will have an initial value of 1. This variable will be a counter. Then, modify the OnControllerColliderHit() function so that, right before the "SceneManager.LoadScene()" statement, you should increase that counter (the "currentLevel" variable) by 1."

26) Copilot from Visual Studio Code."currentLevel = 1;" A line of code was generated by Copilot's chat on VS Code. To activate that, I went to VS Code, and the variable "currentLevel" was being selected on line 11 from `GrabPickups.cs`. So, I clicked on the "currentLevel" variable, and I clicked on "Quick Fix" -> "Use Copilot," and VS Code's Copilot generated the "private int currentLevel = 1;" line of code outside of the `Awake()` function in the `GrabPickups.cs` file. Accessed on April 12th, 2024.

27) Copilot Chat from Pycharm: Professional Edition. (2024, April 12). "/fix This snippet is giving me a bug: instead of increasing by one, it sometimes increases by 2. I'll explain: this script's functionality is that, if the player grabs a purple coin, this will reset the entire level to make it seem as if you went to the next level. Well, to do that, it simply loads the 'Play' scene when the player collides with a pickup. Well, right after doing that, I'm increasing a counter variable called 'currentLevel' right after reloading the 'Play' scene after picking up the pickup. That counter is originally declared with the value of '1' so that it starts at 1. Sometimes, it correctly goes from '1' to '2' when I get from the first level to the 2nd level, and sometimes goes from '2' to '3' when I go to the 3rd level. However, I sometimes get that when I get to the 2nd level, the console prints me a message that I'm on level '3' instead of '2'. Also, sometimes, if I go from level 2 to level 3, the console prints me '4' instead of '3'. Why is this happening? And how can I make sure that this counter is ALWAYS being increased by 1 when I load the 'Play' scene after picking up a pickup?" Highlighted lines 90-91 from the `GrabPickups.cs` file.

28) Copilot Chat from Pycharm: Professional Edition. (2024, April 12). "That sounds nice, but once I get to the next level, I need the pickup to be enabled again.

Accessed on April 12th, 2024.

29) Copilot Chat from Pycharm: Professional Edition. (2024, April 12). "Although, for the first levels, the solution that you gave me worked, during my last test, if I went from level 4 to level 5, the console was printing me that I was on level '6' instead of '5'. Could you make another solution to make sure that the `currentLevel` variable always increases by 1 when I touch the pickup?" Highlighted lines 73-97 from the `GrabPickups.cs` file.

30) Copilot from Visual Studio Code. (2024, April 12). "levelIncreased = false;" A line of code was generated by Copilot's chat on VS Code. To activate that, I went to VS Code, and the variable "levelIncreased" was being selected on line 61 from `GrabPickups.cs`. So, I clicked on the "levelIncreased" variable, and I clicked on "Quick Fix" -> "Use Copilot," and VS Code's Copilot generated the "private bool levelIncreased;" line of code outside of the `Awake()` function in the `GrabPickups.cs` file.
