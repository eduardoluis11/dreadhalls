## Notes

### Possible bug regarding spawning holes

It seems that some of the holes in the floor are spawned below the walls, but I'm not 100% certain that this happens. The console always tells me that 4 holes are rendered on each maze, but I sometimes see less than that. It's probably because I get lost in the maze, and I fail to notice that there are 4 holes in the maze. However, that could be because some holes are spawned below the walls. 

So, I assume that some holes are spawned below the walls, but I'm not sure. If this is indeed the case, I wasn't able to fix this bug.
