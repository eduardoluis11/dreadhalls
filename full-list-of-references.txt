Also, Now 5 holes are being spawned isntead of 4. Even the console tells me that only 4 holes are being spawned, even though there are 5 holes beaing spawned. I want the game to only spawn 4 holes, not 5. I suspect that the 5th hole that's always being rendered is the one that's being rendered beneath the player's initial position.

That's because I don't want the song that was playing on the "Play" and the "GameOver" scene to be playing on the "Title" scene, since the "Title" scene already has its own music, and I don't want both songs to be overlapping one another.

On the Awake() function, declare a variable that is called "currentLevel", which will be an integer and will have an initial value of 1. This variable will be a counter. Then, modify the OnControllerColliderHit() function so that, right before the "SceneManager.LoadScene()" statement, you should increase that counter (the "currentLevel" variable) by 1.

27) /fix This snippet is giving me a bug: instead of increasing by one, it sometimes increases by 2. I'll explain: this script's functionality is that, if the player grabs a purple coin, this will reset the entire level to make it seem as if you went to the next level. Well, to do that, it simply loeads the "Play" scene when the player collides with a pickup. Well, right after doing that, I'm increasing a counter variable called "currentLevel" right after reloading the "Play" scene after picking up the pickup. That counter is originally declared with the value of "1" so that it starts at 1. Sometimes, it correctly goes from "1" to "2" when I get from the first level to the 2nd level, and sometimes goes from "2" to "3" when I go to the 3rd level. However, I sometimes get that, when I get to the 2nd level, the console prints me a message that I'm on level "3" instead of "2". Also, simetimes, if I go from level 2 to level 3, the consoel prints me "4" instead of "3". Why is this happening? And how can I make sure that this counter is ALWAYS being increased by 1 when I load the "Play" scene after picking up a pickup?
