1) @workspace /fix This is giving me an error in the Unity engine. The error says "Assets\Standard Assets\Utility\ForcedReset.cs(7,27): 
error CS0246: The type or namespace name 'UI' could not be found (are you missing a using directive or an assembly reference?) ". This is 
the line that is giving me the error. How can I fix this bug?
