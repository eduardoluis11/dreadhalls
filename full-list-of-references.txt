1) @workspace /fix This is giving me an error in the Unity engine. The error says "Assets\Standard Assets\Utility\ForcedReset.cs(7,27): 
error CS0246: The type or namespace name 'UI' could not be found (are you missing a using directive or an assembly reference?) ". This is 
the line that is giving me the error. How can I fix this bug?

In fact, if I put "numberOfHoles" as "100", the floor doesn't render at all, and I fall through the floor. Could you please check the code if it's just rendering the entire floor or not rendering the floor at all if the "randomChance" generator is less than 95%?"

spawned benath the walls. The need to be beneath the floor tiles of the maze. That is, after the highlighted snippet
"crawls" through the walls to create the maze whe you will move around, the holes should only be created on the maze
that was created by this "crawler". Well, is there a way to make sure that the holes on the floor only spawn on the
maze roads that are created by this "crawler", so that the holes are never spawned beneath any walls?"

11) "/fix Thanks, now holes are never spawned beneath walls. However, now I have a bug that always spawns a hole beneath the initial position of the player. That is, unless you move the player character right when the game starts, you will always begin the game by falling though a hole. I NEVER want to spawn a hole beneath the player's starting position. Also, Now 5 holes are being spawned isntead of 4. Even the console tells me that only 4 holes are being spawned, even though there are 5 holes beaing spawned. I want the game to only spawn 4 holes, not 5. I suspect that the 5th hole that's always being rendered is the one that's being rendered beneath the player's initial position. So please, fix this snippet to ensure that only 4 holes are rendered, and that a hole is never spawned beneath the player's initial position."

16) Well, is there a way to modify this script so that, if the y position of the camera mid-game is less than -10, that a console message that says "Game Over" could show up? That is, could you put a similar snippet to this one on this script?: " // DEBUG: This will send the player to the next level if the fall through a hole void Update() {<pre> // If the player falls below the height of -10. // BUGGY: this didn't work. if (characterController.transform.position.y < -10) { // DEBUG: The player will be sent to the next level (I will later change this to a "Game Over" screen).
