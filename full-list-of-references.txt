1) @workspace /fix This is giving me an error in the Unity engine. The error says "Assets\Standard Assets\Utility\ForcedReset.cs(7,27): 
error CS0246: The type or namespace name 'UI' could not be found (are you missing a using directive or an assembly reference?) ". This is 
the line that is giving me the error. How can I fix this bug?

6) "/fix What this code is actually doing is that it either renders all the floor tiles, or it renders none. That's not what I wanto. What I want are just aa few holes in the floor. In fact, if I put "numberOfHoles" as "100", the floor doesn't render at all, and I fall through the floor. Could you please check the code if it's just rendering the entire floor or not rendering the floor at all if the "randomChance" generator is less than 95%?"
